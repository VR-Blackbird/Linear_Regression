Linear Regression:

- I have built a linear regression model with the training dataset.
- This model used gradient descent for optimisation.
- Since I have used vectorization, this model works well with multiple features as well. (Note: Make sure to clean the data 
  and apply normalization if the features are too large).
- Consider feature reduction based on the p-values for each feature with the lowest significance.
- Wondering about p-values ? Check this out --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z9OIYA8He8
- Feel free to test this model with the test dataset I have provided.
